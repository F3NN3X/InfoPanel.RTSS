# CHANGELOG

## v1.1.5 (October 23, 2025)

### üéØ **User-Configurable Game Categories**
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Added support for custom game categories via INI file
- **New INI Sections**: 
  - Create `[Game_Category_YourCategoryName]` sections to define custom categories
  - Support for both individual patterns (`pattern1=`, `pattern2=`) and comma-separated lists (`processes=`)
  - Wildcard pattern matching with `*` support (e.g., `*valorant*`, `game*.exe`)
- **Configuration Service Enhancement**: Extended `GetCustomGameCategories()` method to parse user-defined categories
- **Game Categorization Logic**: Modified `RTSSDataAnalyzer.GetGameCategory()` to prioritize custom user rules over default categories
- **Pattern Matching**: Added flexible `IsPatternMatch()` helper supporting exact matches and wildcard patterns
- **Example Categories**: Pre-configured examples for Competitive FPS, Racing Games, VR Games, and Retro Games
- **Backward Compatibility**: Default categorization still works when no custom categories are defined

### üß™ **[REMOVED] Experimental RTSS Statistics Control**
- **Added Then Removed**: Experimental feature to enable RTSS statistics recording programmatically
- **Issue**: Caused InfoPanel crashes when enabled 
- **Resolution**: Completely removed in v1.1.5 for stability

### üóëÔ∏è **Complete Removal of Min/Avg/Max FPS Statistics**

**üßπ Console Output Cleanup & Legacy Code Removal**

### üîá **Console Output Cleanup**
- **Eliminated InfoPanel Console Flooding**: Replaced all `Console.WriteLine` statements with file-based logging
  - **Main Plugin**: Converted 10+ console outputs to `_fileLogger.LogInfo()` calls
  - **SensorManagementService**: Replaced 22+ console outputs with conditional file logging
  - **SystemInformationService**: Converted 15+ console outputs to file logging
  - **ConfigurationService**: Replaced console outputs with explanatory comments (file logger unavailable during initialization)

### üöÄ **Debug Logging Performance Optimization**
- **Fixed Excessive Debug Logging**: Resolved debug log files growing extremely large (30,000+ lines)
  - **Root Cause**: High-frequency event handlers (16ms gaming updates) calling `LogInfo` multiple times per cycle

### üìä **Fixed FPS Statistics Duplication Issue**
- **Problem**: Average/Min/Max FPS all showed identical values (same as current FPS)
- **Root Cause**: RTSS statistical fields require active recording (`STATFLAG_RECORD`) and accumulated data (`dwStatCount > 0`)
- **Solution**: Added proper RTSS statistics validation before using statistical data
  - **Statistics Check**: Read `dwStatFlags` (offset 268) and `dwStatCount` (offset 280) from RTSS shared memory
  - **Conditional Usage**: Only use `dwStatFramerateMin/Avg/Max` when statistics recording is active and has data
  - **Fallback Behavior**: Use current FPS for Min/Avg/Max when RTSS statistics are not available
  - **User Visibility**: Added debug logging to show when statistical data vs. fallback values are used

  - **Header File Analysis**: Examined `RTSSSharedMemory.h` and found `dwResolutionX`/`dwResolutionY` fields
  - **Game Render Resolution**: RTSS provides actual game rendering resolution, not just window size
  - **Critical Distinction**: Game render resolution (1920x1080) vs window resolution (3840x2160 fullscreen)

- **Implemented Proper RTSS Resolution Reading**: Using official documented offsets from v2.20+
  - **Correct Offsets**: `dwResolutionX` at offset +9216, `dwResolutionY` at offset +9220 from app entry
  - **Version Detection**: Only reads resolution fields from RTSS v2.20+ (0x00020014) to prevent issues with older versions
  - **Data Validation**: Ensures resolution values are reasonable (1x1 to 7680x4320) before acceptance
  - **Hybrid Fallback**: Uses Windows API window size when RTSS resolution unavailable (< v2.20 or invalid data)

  - **Real Game Resolution**: Shows what the game engine actually renders at before scaling to display
  - **Fullscreen Accuracy**: Correctly detects 1920x1080 game resolution even in 3840x2160 fullscreen window

### üö´ **Game Resolution Feature Removal**
- **Removed Confusing Game Resolution Sensor**: Eliminated due to inconsistent behavior between display modes
  - **Problem Identified**: Borderless fullscreen showed display resolution (3840x2160) instead of game render resolution (1920x1080)
  - **User Confusion**: Most users prefer borderless fullscreen but got misleading resolution data
  - **Decision**: Complete removal better than inconsistent/confusing information

- **Comprehensive Resolution Code Cleanup**: Removed all game resolution detection infrastructure

## v1.1.0 (October 20, 2025)

**üéØ Major FPS Accuracy & Consistency Improvements**

### ‚ú® **Enhanced FPS Calculation**
- **Period-Based FPS Algorithm**: Switched from instantaneous frame time calculation to period-based averaging
  - **Formula**: `(1000.0 * frameCount) / (time1 - time0)` - matches RTSS's averaging method
  - **Benefit**: Much smoother FPS display - eliminates rapid fluctuations seen with per-frame calculation
  - **Example**: 60 FPS locked now shows stable 60.0 instead of jumping 58-62
  - **Data Source**: Uses `dwTime0`, `dwTime1`, and `dwFrames` from RTSS shared memory (offsets 268, 272, 276)

### üîß **Frame Time Consistency Fix**
- **Derived Calculation**: Frame time now calculated directly from period FPS for perfect consistency
  - **Formula**: `frameTimeMs = 1000.0 / periodFps`
  - **Previous Issue**: Raw `dwFrameTime` (instantaneous) didn't match averaged period FPS
  - **Result**: Frame time and FPS values now perfectly aligned
  - **Example**: PeriodFPS=150.6 ‚Üí FrameTime=6.64ms (1000/150.6) ‚úì

### üìä **RTSS Built-In Statistics Integration**
- **New Sensors**: Added Min/Avg/Max FPS sensors from RTSS's pre-calculated statistics
  - **Offsets**: `dwStatFramerateMin` (304), `dwStatFramerateAvg` (308), `dwStatFramerateMax` (312)
  - **Format**: Statistics stored as millihertz (divided by 1000 for FPS display)
  - **Validation**: Proper checks for `dwStatFlags` (284) and `dwStatCount` (300) before reading
  - **Note**: Requires RTSS statistics to be manually enabled in RTSS settings

### üõ°Ô∏è **Statistics Validation**
- **Uninitialized Value Detection**: Added `0xFFFFFFFF` check to prevent displaying invalid statistics
  - **Previous Issue**: Invalid values showed as 4294967.3 FPS (max uint32 / 1000)
  - **Current Behavior**: Shows 0.0 when statistics unavailable or invalid
  - **Validation Flags**: Reads `dwStatFlags` and `dwStatCount` to verify statistics are ready
  - **Safety**: Only displays statistics when `statFlags != 0 && statCount > 0 && value != 0xFFFFFFFF`

### üìù **Technical Improvements**
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging with StatFlags and StatCount values for troubleshooting
- **Memory Safety**: All statistics reads protected by validation checks
- **Performance**: Period-based calculation reduces CPU overhead vs per-frame calculation

### üóëÔ∏è **Removed Features**
- **GPU Frame Time Sensor**: Removed from roadmap (offset 679 reserved for future use)
  - Reason: Focus on core FPS metrics first, may revisit in future versions
