## v1.1.2 (October 22, 2025)

**üéØ RTSS-First Title Detection & Improved Stability**

### ‚ú® **New Features**

## v1.1.1 (October 21, 2025)

**üêû Debug Logging for User Troubleshooting**

### ‚ú® **New Features**
- **File-Based Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to `debug.log` in plugin directory
  - **Purpose**: Help troubleshoot user issues where plugin shows no FPS
  - **Location**: `C:\ProgramData\InfoPanel\plugins\InfoPanel.RTSS\debug.log`
  - **Content**: Plugin initialization, RTSS detection attempts, FPS updates, system information, errors
  - **Safety**: Thread-safe file writing with proper exception handling

### üîß **Enhanced Debugging**
- **Plugin Lifecycle Logging**: Tracks constructor, initialization, service startup, and disposal
- **RTSS Detection Logging**: Detailed logs of RTSS shared memory attempts and hook detection
  - Logs retry attempts (e.g., "Waiting for RTSS to hook game... (5/60s)")
  - Records successful detection: "RTSS hook detected after X seconds"
  - Reports failures: "RTSS not detected after 60 seconds, falling back to GPU counters"
- **FPS Update Logging**: Records actual FPS values from RTSS with timestamps
- **System Information Logging**: GPU name, display resolution, and refresh rate
- **Error Logging**: Full exception details with stack traces for debugging

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**
- **FileLoggingService**: New service class for centralized file logging
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper disposal with session end markers
- **Log File Management**: Creates new session log on each plugin load
- **Fallback Safety**: Falls back to console logging if file writing fails
- **Integration**: Logging integrated into DXGIFrameMonitoringService and main plugin class

### üìù **For Users Experiencing Issues**
When reporting "no FPS showing" problems, please share the `debug.log` file from:
`C:\ProgramData\InfoPanel\plugins\InfoPanel.RTSS\debug.log`

This will help identify:
- Whether RTSS is installed and running
- If RTSS successfully hooks the game
- Any initialization or service startup failures
- System configuration details

## v1.1.0 (October 20, 2025)

**üéØ Major FPS Accuracy & Consistency Improvements**

### ‚ú® **Enhanced FPS Calculation**
- **Period-Based FPS Algorithm**: Switched from instantaneous frame time calculation to period-based averaging
  - **Formula**: `(1000.0 * frameCount) / (time1 - time0)` - matches RTSS's averaging method
  - **Benefit**: Much smoother FPS display - eliminates rapid fluctuations seen with per-frame calculation
  - **Example**: 60 FPS locked now shows stable 60.0 instead of jumping 58-62
  - **Data Source**: Uses `dwTime0`, `dwTime1`, and `dwFrames` from RTSS shared memory (offsets 268, 272, 276)

### üîß **Frame Time Consistency Fix**
- **Derived Calculation**: Frame time now calculated directly from period FPS for perfect consistency
  - **Formula**: `frameTimeMs = 1000.0 / periodFps`
  - **Previous Issue**: Raw `dwFrameTime` (instantaneous) didn't match averaged period FPS
  - **Result**: Frame time and FPS values now perfectly aligned
  - **Example**: PeriodFPS=150.6 ‚Üí FrameTime=6.64ms (1000/150.6) ‚úì

### üìä **RTSS Built-In Statistics Integration**
- **New Sensors**: Added Min/Avg/Max FPS sensors from RTSS's pre-calculated statistics
  - **Offsets**: `dwStatFramerateMin` (304), `dwStatFramerateAvg` (308), `dwStatFramerateMax` (312)
  - **Format**: Statistics stored as millihertz (divided by 1000 for FPS display)
  - **Validation**: Proper checks for `dwStatFlags` (284) and `dwStatCount` (300) before reading
  - **Note**: Requires RTSS statistics to be manually enabled in RTSS settings

### üõ°Ô∏è **Statistics Validation**
- **Uninitialized Value Detection**: Added `0xFFFFFFFF` check to prevent displaying invalid statistics
  - **Previous Issue**: Invalid values showed as 4294967.3 FPS (max uint32 / 1000)
  - **Current Behavior**: Shows 0.0 when statistics unavailable or invalid
  - **Validation Flags**: Reads `dwStatFlags` and `dwStatCount` to verify statistics are ready
  - **Safety**: Only displays statistics when `statFlags != 0 && statCount > 0 && value != 0xFFFFFFFF`

### üìù **Technical Improvements**
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging with StatFlags and StatCount values for troubleshooting
- **Memory Safety**: All statistics reads protected by validation checks
- **Performance**: Period-based calculation reduces CPU overhead vs per-frame calculation

### üóëÔ∏è **Removed Features**
- **GPU Frame Time Sensor**: Removed from roadmap (offset 679 reserved for future use)
  - Reason: Focus on core FPS metrics first, may revisit in future versions
