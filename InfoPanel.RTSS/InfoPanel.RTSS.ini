[FPS_Monitoring]
# PresentMon ETW-based frame presentation tracking for accurate FPS monitoring
# Uses Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to monitor frame presentation events
# Anti-cheat compatible - no DLL injection or memory hooking required
# Works with D3D12, D3D11, OpenGL, and Vulkan games including Battlefield 6

[Debug]
# Enable/disable debug logging to debug.log file and console debug output
# Set to true to enable detailed logging for troubleshooting (RTSS, sensors, window capture)
# Set to false to disable debug logging for production use
debug=false

[Display]
# Update interval in milliseconds for UI updates
updateInterval=1000

# Number of frames to use for smoothing calculations
smoothingFrames=60

# Default message to display when no game is being captured
defaultCaptureMessage=No game detected

[Application_Filtering]
# Comma-separated list of process names to ignore (case-insensitive, without .exe)
# These applications will be skipped even if RTSS is monitoring them
# Example: StreamDeck,Teams,Teams.msix,Discord,Chrome
ignored_processes=

# Only monitor applications with FPS above this threshold
# Applications with 0.0 FPS (like Stream Deck) will be ignored
# Set to 0 to disable FPS-based filtering
minimum_fps_threshold=1.0

# Prefer fullscreen applications over windowed ones
prefer_fullscreen=true

# Custom Game Categories
# Define your own game categories by creating sections named [Game_Category_YourCategoryName]
# You can use exact process names, wildcard patterns (*), or comma-separated lists

[Game_Category_My Favorite Games]
# Individual pattern entries
pattern1=cyberpunk2077.exe
pattern2=*witcher*
pattern3=*battlefield*
# Or use a comma-separated list
processes=eldenring.exe,sekiro.exe,*souls*

[Game_Category_Competitive FPS]
processes=*valorant*,*csgo*,*cs2*,*overwatch*,*apex*,*rainbow*

[Game_Category_Racing Games]
processes=*forza*,*gran*,*dirt*,*f1*,*crew*,*nfs*

[Game_Category_VR Games]
processes=*vr*,*reality*,*alyx*,*beat*saber*

[Game_Category_Retro Games]
processes=*dosbox*,*scummvm*,*retroarch*,*emulator*

# Examples of pattern matching:
# exact.exe        - Exact match for "exact.exe"
# *steam*          - Any process containing "steam"
# game*.exe        - Processes starting with "game" and ending with ".exe"
# *epic*games*     - Processes containing both "epic" and "games"
