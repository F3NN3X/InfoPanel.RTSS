# InfoPanel.RTSS Plugin

A plugin for the InfoPanel app that reads FPS data directly from RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) to monitor and display real-time performance metrics for fullscreen applications with anti-cheat compatibility.

## Overview

InfoPanel.RTSS provides detailed performance statistics for running fullscreen applications, enabling users to monitor gaming performance in real-time through InfoPanel's interface. By leveraging RTSS's shared memory, the plugin achieves pixel-perfect FPS accuracy while remaining compatible with kernel-level anti-cheat systems. The plugin tracks FPS, frame times, and low percentile data, updating every second with efficient event-driven detection.

**Version:** 1.1.5  
**Author:** F3NN3X

> **ðŸ”§ Latest Update:** Version 1.1.5 includes a critical fix for graphics API detection, ensuring Vulkan games are now correctly identified instead of being misdetected as DirectX 11.

## Features

* **Anti-Cheat Compatible**: Uses RTSS shared memory for non-invasive FPS monitoring, compatible with kernel-level anti-cheat systems (BattlEye, EAC, Vanguard, etc.)
* **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and displays performance metrics for fullscreen applications with second-by-second updates.
* **Multiple Performance Metrics**:
  * Current Frames Per Second (FPS) - read directly from RTSS overlay
  * Frame time in milliseconds - calculated for pixel-perfect accuracy
  * 1% Low FPS (99th percentile) - 100-frame rolling window for stutter detection
* **Display Information**:
  * Main display resolution (e.g., "3840x2160")
  * Main display refresh rate (e.g., "240Hz")
  * GPU name detection
* **Window Title Reporting**: Shows the title of the currently monitored fullscreen application.
* **Efficient Resource Usage**:
  * Event-driven detection ensures immediate startup when fullscreen apps launch
  * Proper cleanup and metric clearing when fullscreen apps close
  * Optimized calculations with minimal resource overhead
  * Thread-safe sensor updates prevent crashes during rapid state changes
* **Multi-monitor Support**: Accurate fullscreen detection on multiple monitor setups.
* **Universal Game Support**: Works with any game without hardcoded process names or special handling.
* **Advanced Graphics API Detection**: Accurately identifies graphics technologies and process architectures

## Graphics API & Architecture Detection

InfoPanel.RTSS provides detailed graphics API and architecture detection using modern RTSS shared memory analysis. This information helps understand the rendering technology and process type of monitored applications.

### Supported Graphics APIs

The plugin automatically detects and displays the following graphics APIs:

| **Graphics API** | **Description** | **Example Games** |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Vulkan** | Modern low-level graphics API | No Man's Sky, DOOM Eternal, Red Dead Redemption 2 |
| **DirectX 12** | Microsoft's modern low-level API | Battlefield 2042, Forza Horizon 5, Cyberpunk 2077 |
| **DirectX 12 AFR** | Multi-GPU Alternate Frame Rendering | SLI/CrossFire enabled games |
| **DirectX 11** | Modern high-level DirectX | Most contemporary games (2010-2020) |
| **DirectX 10** | Legacy DirectX version | Older games (2006-2010) |
| **DirectX 9Ex** | Enhanced DirectX 9 | Windows Vista+ enhanced games |
| **DirectX 9** | Legacy DirectX version | Older games (2002-2008) |
| **DirectX 8** | Legacy DirectX version | Very old games (2000-2004) |
| **OpenGL** | Cross-platform graphics API | Minecraft, older indie games, some AAA titles |
| **DirectDraw** | Legacy 2D graphics API | Retro games, 2D applications |

### Architecture Classifications

Games are categorized into architectural families based on their graphics technology:

| **Architecture Type** | **Graphics APIs** | **Characteristics** |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Modern Low-Level** | Vulkan, DirectX 12, DirectX 12 AFR | Close-to-metal APIs with explicit control |
| **Modern** | DirectX 11 | High-level modern APIs with driver optimization |
| **Traditional** | DirectX 9/9Ex/10, OpenGL | Established APIs with mature toolchains |
| **Legacy** | DirectX 8, DirectDraw | Older technologies for retro/compatibility |

### Process Architecture Detection

The plugin also detects the process architecture from RTSS flags:

| **Process Type** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **x64** | 64-bit native process |
| **x86** | 32-bit native process |
| **UWP** | Universal Windows Platform app |
| **x64 UWP** | 64-bit UWP application |

### Combined Architecture Display

The plugin combines graphics API classification with process architecture for comprehensive information:

**Examples:**
- `"Modern Low-Level (x64)"` - Vulkan/DirectX 12 running as 64-bit process
- `"Modern (x86)"` - DirectX 11 running as 32-bit process  
- `"Traditional (x64 UWP)"` - OpenGL running as 64-bit UWP app
- `"Legacy (x86)"` - DirectX 8 running as 32-bit process

### Technical Implementation

- **RTSS v2.10+ Compatibility**: Uses modern APPFLAG enumerated values instead of deprecated bit flags
- **Accurate Detection**: Fixes previous issues where Vulkan games were misidentified as DirectX 11
- **Real-time Analysis**: Graphics API detection updates in real-time as games launch
- **Debug Logging**: Console output shows raw RTSS flags and detected API values for troubleshooting

## Requirements

* InfoPanel app (latest version recommended)
* Windows operating system
* **RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS)** - Required for FPS monitoring
  * Download from: [Guru3D - RivaTuner Statistics Server](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html)
  * Or install MSI Afterburner (includes RTSS): [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner)
  * RTSS must be running for the plugin to capture FPS data

## RTSS Setup & Configuration

### What is RTSS?

RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) is a powerful overlay application that provides on-screen display (OSD) functionality for monitoring hardware statistics and FPS in games. This plugin reads FPS data directly from RTSS's shared memory, making it compatible with anti-cheat protected games.

### Installation

1. **Download and Install RTSS**:
   - Standalone: Download from [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html)
   - Or install MSI Afterburner which includes RTSS

2. **Configure RTSS**:
   - Launch RTSS (RivaTunerStatisticsServer.exe)
   - Make sure RTSS is running and enabled (system tray icon should be visible)
   - RTSS will automatically hook into games when they launch

3. **Verify Operation**:
   - Launch a fullscreen game
   - You should see the RTSS overlay in-game (if enabled)
   - InfoPanel.RTSS will read the same FPS values RTSS displays

### Important Notes

- **RTSS Must Be Running**: The plugin requires RTSS to be running before launching games. If RTSS is not detected, no FPS data will be available.
  
- **Hook Timing**: RTSS may take a few seconds to hook into newly launched games (up to 60 seconds for first launch). During this time:
  - Window title may show "Nothing to capture"
  - FPS data will appear once RTSS hooks the game
  - This is normal behavior and not a plugin error

- **Overlay Not Required**: You don't need to have RTSS's on-screen overlay enabled. The plugin reads from shared memory regardless of overlay visibility.

- **Anti-Cheat Compatibility**: RTSS is widely accepted by anti-cheat systems because it uses non-invasive DirectX hooking. This plugin reads data passively from RTSS without any injection.

- **Pixel-Perfect Accuracy**: FPS values match RTSS overlay exactly, calculated from the same data source (RTSS Frames field at offset 276).

### Troubleshooting

**No FPS Data Displayed:**
- Verify RTSS is running (check system tray)
- Launch the game and wait 10-60 seconds for RTSS to hook
- Check RTSS settings to ensure game hooking is enabled
- Some games may need to be added to RTSS's application profile

**Window Title Shows "Nothing to capture":**
- This typically means RTSS hasn't hooked the game yet
- Wait a few more seconds - title will appear once RTSS connects
- If it persists, restart RTSS and relaunch the game

## Notes

* **RTSS Required**: This plugin requires RTSS to be running. Without RTSS, no FPS data will be available.
* **Hook Delay**: On first game launch, RTSS may take 10-60 seconds to hook the game. This is normal - be patient.
* **Accuracy**: FPS values are read directly from RTSS's Frames field, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy matching the overlay.
* For detailed version history, please refer to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
