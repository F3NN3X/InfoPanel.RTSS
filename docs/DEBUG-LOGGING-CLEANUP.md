# Debug Logging Cleanup - Clean InfoPanel Console

## Problem Solved
The InfoPanel application was receiving debug output from the plugin in its console, which cluttered the user interface and made debugging difficult. Users reported seeing messages like:

```
Enhanced sensors updated - FPS: 150.7, API: Vulkan, Category: Competitive Gaming, Res: Unknown  
Performance sensors updated - FPS: 150.73892, FrameTime: 6.63ms, 1%Low: 149.6063
[DEBUG] UpdateWindowSensor - IsValid: True, PID: 39440, Handle: 1, Fullscreen: True, Title: 'No Man's Sky'
[DEBUG] Setting title to: 'No Man's Sky' (from 'No Man's Sky')
[DEBUG] Title sensor updated to: 'No Man's Sky'
```

## Solution Implemented
Moved all debug output from `Console.WriteLine` to centralized file logging via `FileLoggingService`, ensuring clean InfoPanel console while maintaining comprehensive debugging capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. SensorManagementService.cs
- **Added**: `FileLoggingService` dependency via constructor parameter
- **Replaced**: 20+ `Console.WriteLine` statements with `_fileLogger?.LogXxx()` calls
- **Enhanced**: Thread-safe logging with appropriate log levels (Debug, Info, Error)

### 2. SystemInformationService.cs  
- **Added**: `FileLoggingService` constructor parameter and field
- **Replaced**: 12+ `Console.WriteLine` statements with file logging
- **Organized**: Log levels by importance (Debug for details, Warning for issues, Error for failures)

### 3. ConfigurationService.cs
- **Added**: `SetFileLogger()` method to handle chicken-and-egg initialization problem
- **Added**: `LogMessage()` helper method with fallback to console when file logger unavailable
- **Replaced**: 18+ `Console.WriteLine` statements with smart logging that uses file logger when available, console as fallback
- **Maintained**: Console fallback during early initialization before file logging is ready

### 4. InfoPanel.RTSS.cs (Main Plugin)
- **Updated**: Service constructors to pass `FileLoggingService` instances
- **Enhanced**: Initialization sequence to properly wire up file logging across all services
- **Cleaned**: Removed enhanced metrics handling that wasn't compatible with current simplified version

### 5. Service Integration
- **Pattern**: All services now accept optional `FileLoggingService` parameter
- **Fallback**: ConfigurationService uses console fallback during early initialization, switches to file logging after both services created
- **Consistency**: All debug output now goes to `plugin-debug.log` file instead of InfoPanel console

## Log Output Destination
All plugin debug output now goes to:
- **File**: `plugin-debug.log` in the plugin directory
- **Console**: Clean - only critical initialization failures appear in InfoPanel console
- **Levels**: Structured logging with DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR levels

## Technical Benefits
1. **Clean UI**: InfoPanel console no longer cluttered with plugin debug messages
2. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logs in structured file format with timestamps
3. **User Experience**: Professional appearance without debug spam
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized logging system across all services
5. **Flexibility**: User can disable debug logging via configuration if desired

## Files Modified
- `Services/SensorManagementService.cs` - Moved 20+ console statements to file logging
- `Services/SystemInformationService.cs` - Moved 12+ console statements to file logging  
- `Services/ConfigurationService.cs` - Moved 18+ console statements to smart logging with fallback
- `InfoPanel.RTSS.cs` - Updated service initialization and dependency injection

## Result
✅ **InfoPanel console is now clean** - no more plugin debug spam
✅ **Comprehensive file logging** - all debug info preserved in `plugin-debug.log`
✅ **Proper initialization** - ConfigurationService handles early logging gracefully
✅ **Build successful** - all services properly wired with file logging support

The user will now see a clean InfoPanel interface while having full debugging capabilities in the dedicated log file.
