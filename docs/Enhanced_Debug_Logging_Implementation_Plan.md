## üéØ **Implementation Requirements**

## **Category 1: Enhanced RTSS Data**

### **1.1 RTSS Version Information** ‚≠ê **EASY** (2-3 hours)
**Objective**: Capture and display RTSS version for compatibility troubleshooting

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Read RTSS shared memory header version field (offset 0x4)
- Parse version from `dwSignature` and `dwVersion` fields 
- Display as "RTSS v4.7.0 (Build 32407)" format

**Target Output**:
```log
[INFO] RTSS Version: v4.7.0 Build 32407, Compatible: Yes, Memory Layout: V2
```

**Code Locations**:
- `RTSSOnlyMonitoringService.OpenRTSSSharedMemory()`
- Add version parsing in `TryReadRTSSSharedMemory()`

**Technical Details**:
- RTSS shared memory structure contains version at known offsets
- Version parsing: Major = (dwVersion >> 16) & 0xFFFF, Minor = dwVersion & 0xFFFF
- Build number may be available in extended headers

---

### **1.2 Hook Method Details** ‚≠ê‚≠ê **MEDIUM** (4-6 hours)  
**Objective**: Provide detailed information about RTSS hook implementation and stability

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Extract hook implementation details from RTSS flags
- Track hook establishment timing and stability
- Distinguish between overlay vs statistics-only hooks
- Monitor hook reliability metrics

**Target Output**:
```log
[INFO] RTSS Hook Details - NMS (PID: 40292): API: Vulkan, Method: Statistics+Overlay, Stability: Stable, Hook Age: 5.2s
[INFO] Hook Performance - NMS: Scan Success Rate: 98.5%, Avg Response: 0.6ms, Dropouts: 0
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Extend existing RTSS flag analysis in `GetGraphicsAPI()`
- Add hook timing tracking with `DateTime` stamps
- Implement stability metrics (success rate, response time)
- Track hook method from RTSS application flags

**Enhanced Flag Analysis Needed**:
- `APPFLAG_ARCHITECTURE_*` - Process architecture details
- Hook-specific flags for overlay vs statistics mode
- Stability indicators in RTSS entry lifecycle

---

### **1.3 Process Architecture Enhancement** ‚≠ê **EASY** (1-2 hours)
**Objective**: Extend existing architecture detection with more detailed process information

**Current State**: Basic x64 detection exists via `APPFLAG_ARCHITECTURE_X64`

**Enhancement Strategy**:
- Extend `GetProcessArchitecture()` method
- Add UWP detection and validation
- Include process privilege level detection

**Target Output**:
```log
[INFO] Process Architecture - NMS: x64 Native, Privilege: Standard, UWP: No, Elevated: No
```

**Implementation**:

- Add Win32 API calls for privilege detection
- Extend architecture string formatting

---

### **1.4 Display Mode Changes** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **HARD** (8-12 hours)
**Objective**: Detect and log fullscreen ‚Üî windowed transitions

**Challenge**: RTSS doesn't directly provide display mode changes

**Implementation Options**:
1. **Win32 API Monitoring**: Track window style changes via `GetWindowLongPtr()`
2. **Resolution Change Detection**: Monitor coordinate changes and infer mode switches
3. **Graphics API Integration**: Hook into swapchain mode changes (complex)

**Target Output**:
```log
[INFO] Display Mode Change - NMS: Windowed -> Fullscreen Exclusive (3840x2160@240Hz)
[INFO] Display Mode Change - NMS: Fullscreen -> Borderless Windowed (3840x2160@240Hz)
```

**Technical Approach**:
- Add window style monitoring in `SensorManagementService`
- Implement display mode detection using `GetWindowPlacement()` and `GetWindowRect()`
- Track resolution changes from RTSS data (dwResolutionX/Y fields)
- Correlate window state with resolution data

**Complexity Factors**:
- Multiple monitor setups require careful handling
- Different fullscreen modes (exclusive vs borderless) 
- Game-specific fullscreen implementations vary

---

### **1.5 VSync Status Detection** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **HARD** (6-10 hours)
**Objective**: Determine VSync on/off status through algorithmic analysis

**Challenge**: VSync status not directly exposed in RTSS shared memory structure

**Implementation Strategy** (Inference-Based):
- Analyze FPS vs refresh rate correlation patterns
- Monitor frame pacing consistency
- Detect frame rate limiting patterns
- Statistical analysis of frame delivery timing

**Target Output**:
```log
[INFO] VSync Analysis - NMS: Status: Likely OFF, Evidence: FPS uncapped (149.6 avg), Frame Variance: 12.3ms
[INFO] VSync Analysis - NMS: Status: Likely ON, Evidence: FPS capped at 240, Frame Consistency: 98.2%
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Add frame pacing analysis in frame time buffer processing
- Implement statistical algorithms for pattern detection
- Create VSync inference engine based on multiple metrics
- Track frame delivery consistency over time windows

**Algorithm Considerations**:
- VSync ON: FPS typically matches refresh rate divisors (240, 120, 80, 60, etc.)
- Frame time consistency is higher with VSync enabled
- Adaptive VSync creates complex patterns to analyze

---

### **1.6 Refresh Rate Sync Analysis** ‚≠ê‚≠ê **MEDIUM** (4-6 hours)
**Objective**: Analyze relationship between game FPS and monitor refresh rate

**Current Data Available**: Refresh rate (240Hz) and FPS data from RTSS

**Implementation Strategy**: 
- Calculate FPS/RefreshRate ratios and detect patterns
- Identify common sync patterns (30fps@60Hz, 60fps@120Hz, etc.)
- Detect frame rate limiting and sync technologies
- Monitor refresh rate utilization efficiency

**Target Output**:
```log
[INFO] Sync Analysis - NMS: 149.6 FPS @ 240Hz (62.3% utilization), Pattern: Uncapped, VSync: Likely Off
[INFO] Sync Analysis - NMS: 240.0 FPS @ 240Hz (100% sync), Pattern: Perfect Match, VSync: Detected
[INFO] Sync Analysis - NMS: 120.0 FPS @ 240Hz (50% sync), Pattern: Half Rate, Limiter: Likely Active
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Extend existing FPS monitoring with ratio calculations
- Implement pattern recognition for common sync scenarios
- Add refresh rate utilization percentage tracking
- Create sync pattern classification system

**Pattern Detection Logic**:
- Perfect sync: FPS ‚âà Refresh Rate (¬±2%)
- Half sync: FPS ‚âà Refresh Rate / 2 (¬±2%)
- Third sync: FPS ‚âà Refresh Rate / 3 (¬±2%)
- Uncapped: FPS varies significantly from refresh rate patterns
